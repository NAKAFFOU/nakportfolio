											<h2>Cloud Operations and Management</h2>
											<p>by Dr Zeeshan Siddiqui</p>
										</header>
										<p>
                                           Cloud computing has evolved from a primarily cost-saving approach to a transformative force shaping digital business models. Through this module, Cloud Operations and Management, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the cloud ecosystem—covering fundamental service models, deployment options, and advanced architectures that include artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. Initially, I perceived the cloud as primarily offering scalable storage and computing power. However, over twelve weeks, I learned to see it as a strategic enabler for innovation, resilience, and sustainability across various industries. This e-Portfolio critically reflects on my learning journey, emphasising key insights, technical skills, and real-world applications. Each section demonstrates how theoretical knowledge was translated into practical skills and how these experiences have reshaped my view of modern IT operations.										</p>

														<h3>Weekly Reflections on Key Topics</h3>
													</header>
													<p>
														Reflecting on the module's trajectory, I have selected five pivotal topics that profoundly shaped my understanding of cloud computing's role in modern IT practices.
													</p>

													<h4>1. Understanding Cloud Architecture and Frameworks (Unit 2)</h4>
													<p>
														Unit 2, “Understanding Cloud Architecture and Implementing Different Frameworks,” established the theoretical foundation for designing and managing cloud systems strategically. It moved beyond basic definitions of cloud computing to explore structured methodologies that align technological solutions with business objectives. I found the introduction of <strong>TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)</strong> particularly insightful, as it provides a systematic approach to aligning IT architecture with enterprise strategy. The study by Anggraini et al. (2019) demonstrated how TOGAF can be integrated with the ROCCA cloud adoption model to define baseline requirements and ensure that technology initiatives remain business-driven.
													</p>
													<p>
														The unit also addressed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in a cloud context, where agility and automation replace linear processes. The concept of <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>—automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure—was especially transformative. It illustrated how architecture and deployment can evolve from manual tasks into code-driven, repeatable operations.
													</p>
													<p>
														Reflecting on this unit, I realised that the success of cloud adoption depends less on specific technologies and more on strategic planning. Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks such as TOGAF and ROCCA ensure that cloud initiatives are coherent, adaptable, and measurable (Abd-Elvahab et al., 2023). In essence, technology provides capability, but strategy defines purpose. This understanding shifted my mindset from focusing solely on tools to prioritising governance, value alignment, and scalability in every architectural decision.
													</p>

														Abd-Elvahab, A. M., Mohamed, A. G. &amp; Shaaban, E. M. (2023) ‘Microservices-driven enterprise architecture model for infrastructure optimisation’, <em>Future Business Journal</em>, 9(1), p. 90.
													</p>

													<h4>2. Cloud-Native Technologies and Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Solutions (Units 5 &amp; 6)</h4>
													<p>
														These units deepened my understanding of the balance between innovation, agility, and complexity in cloud-native and hybrid models. The study of <strong>serverless computing</strong> (Ni et al., 2024) revealed both its operational elegance and security challenges. By quantifying security risks through Attack–Defense Trees, the authors showed that even when individual vulnerabilities are mitigated, cumulative exposure remains significant. This insight reshaped my perception of the shared responsibility model, which becomes increasingly intricate as abstraction levels rise.
													</p>
													<p>
														Simultaneously, exploring <strong>microservices architectures</strong> (Abd-Elvahab et al., 2023) demonstrated how modular systems enhance scalability and agility but introduce challenges in integration, monitoring, and governance. The reflection on hybrid and multi-cloud models, exemplified in Anggraini et al. (2019), reinforced that while these architectures optimise control and compliance, they also expand the attack surface.
													</p>
													<p>
														Critically, I learned that agility without robust governance is unsustainable. The <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0</strong> (NIST, 2024) emerged as a vital tool—providing a common language and measurable outcomes to manage risk across heterogeneous environments. Reflecting on my own professional practice, this unit reinforced the importance of embedding security and architectural discipline as core design principles rather than reactive measures.
													</p>

													</p>

													<h4>3. Cloud Security and Compliance (Unit 7)</h4>
													<p>
														This unit challenged me to rethink cloud security as a continuous, integrated discipline rather than a set of reactive measures. The works of Baldini et al. (2016) and Gundu et al. (2020) highlighted that the move towards serverless and multi-cloud architectures has redefined the traditional security perimeter.
													</p>
													<p>
														Firstly, the shared responsibility model has evolved. In serverless environments, the cloud provider handles operational layers such as runtime and patching, but clients retain accountability for identity, configuration, and application logic (Baldini et al., 2016). This underscores the need for “shift-left” security—embedding protection mechanisms at the earliest stages of development.
													</p>
													<p>
														Secondly, the multi-cloud paradigm introduces an expanded attack surface. Gundu et al. (2020) noted that managing consistent security policies across providers is complex, often leading to configuration drift and increased data transit risks. Reflecting on this, I understood the criticality of centralised visibility and governance to meet compliance obligations such as ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR.
													</p>
													<p>
														Finally, I learned that emerging architectural responses—such as multi-cloud exchanges and direct interconnects—can enhance performance and reduce exposure but simultaneously centralise risk. This duality reminded me that every optimisation introduces trade-offs. Overall, Unit 7 reinforced that effective cloud security demands proactive governance, automation, and a culture of shared accountability across teams.

(2020) ‘Hybrid IT and Multi Cloud – An Emerging Trend and Improved Performance in Cloud Computing’, <em>SN Computer Science</em>, 1(256). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-020-00277-x">https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-020-00277-x</a>
													</p>

													<h4>4. Disaster Recovery and Cloud Migration (Units 8 &amp; 9)</h4>
													<p>
														These units emphasised the strategic interdependence between cloud migration and disaster recovery (DR). Through the readings by Carson and Rodrick (2024), I learned that modern DR strategies are inseparable from the migration process itself. Cloud platforms enable <strong>Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)</strong>, allowing organisations to maintain cost-efficient, scalable standby environments that meet strict Recovery Time and Point Objectives (RTO/RPO).
													</p>
													<p>
														A key takeaway for me was the shift from capital-intensive redundancy to elastic resilience. However, migration success depends on understanding the shared responsibility model across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. While providers guarantee infrastructure resilience, customers must architect and test their own recovery processes. This reinforced my view that DR planning is not optional but a strategic design imperative.
													</p>
													<p>
														Security emerged as another crucial dimension. The use of direct interconnects such as Azure ExpressRoute ensures secure, high-bandwidth replication channels—mitigating risks from public internet exposure. Yet, as Dunbar (2024) warned, the extensive use of proprietary cloud services introduces vendor lock-in, complicating future migrations or multi-cloud DR.
													</p>
													<p>
														Reflectively, I realised that flexibility and resilience must coexist. A well-architected DR strategy is not just a safety net—it is an operational capability that sustains business continuity and customer trust in the digital era.

														Zheng, Y. et al. (2024) ‘Optimization model for vehicular network data queries in edge environments’, <em>Journal of Cloud Computing</em>, 13, pp. 1–15.
													</p>

													<h4>5. AI and Cloud Computing (Unit 11)</h4>
													<p>
														The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing emerged as one of the most transformative themes of the module. While the lectures emphasised technical integration—AI leveraging cloud scalability and cloud leveraging AI for optimisation—the paper by Carugati (2023) expanded my understanding by situating this relationship within the broader digital-economy power dynamic.
													</p>
													<p>
														The interdependence between cloud hyperscalers and AI developers represents a mutual dependence that drives innovation and competition. Cloud platforms provide the computational infrastructure necessary for training large-scale models, while AI workloads generate massive demand for cloud resources, reinforcing growth for providers. As Carugati (2023) notes, this creates a self-reinforcing cycle in which technological and economic forces are intertwined.
													</p>
													<p>
														I found it particularly enlightening to explore how this dynamic spans all service layers: at the IaaS level, hyperscalers differentiate through proprietary hardware such as TPUs and Trainium; at PaaS, platforms like Azure OpenAI Service curate AI ecosystems; and at SaaS, AI integration transforms productivity suites such as Microsoft 365 Copilot.
													</p>
													<p>
														However, this symbiosis also poses risks—vendor lock-in, market concentration, and hardware bottlenecks—which threaten innovation and fair competition. Reflecting on this, I now view cloud–AI integration not only as a technical achievement but as a strategic and ethical frontier. As regulatory frameworks like the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) emerge, the industry must balance progress with fairness and transparency.

												<h3>Application to Industry: The Port Authority of Cotonou</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>The culmination of my learning was a detailed project for <strong>The Port Authority of Cotonou (PAC)</strong>, which served as a practical application of the module's core tenets. PAC faced significant inefficiencies in its manual, paper-based accounts payable process.</p>

                                                    <p>My solution architected a <strong>sovereign hybrid cloud model</strong> to address this challenge directly. The design hosted all sensitive data and core microservices within a national data centre to ensure compliance with Beninese data laws, while leveraging <strong>Microsoft Azure's</strong> public cloud for its advanced <strong>AI Services (Form Recogniser)</strong>. This hybrid approach perfectly balanced the need for data sovereignty with the power of cloud innovation.</p>
                                                    <p>The implementation directly utilised my developed skills:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li><strong>IaC (Terraform/Ansible)</strong> automated the provisioning of the entire environment, ensuring a secure, repeatable, and scalable deployment.</li>   
                                                        <li><strong>AI and Automation</strong> were integrated to create an intelligent workflow where invoices were automatically processed, data was extracted and validated, and the JD Edwards ERP system was updated without manual intervention.</li>   
                                                        <li><strong>Cloud Security</strong> principles were enforced through a defence-in-depth strategy, featuring a Zero Trust network model, RBAC, MFA, and end-to-end encryption.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>This project demonstrated that cloud computing is a transformative force for the public sector. It provided PAC with more than just a faster accounts payable process; it established a <strong>modern, resilient, and intelligent digital foundation</strong>. This platform can now support future innovations like edge computing for IoT sensor data in the port or predictive analytics for logistics management, positioning PAC as a digital leader in West Africa.</p>

											</header>
                                            <p>Building upon the advanced technologies from the final units, my plan for continuous professional development is structured and focused:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Kubernetes Certification:</strong> To validate and deepen my container orchestration expertise, I will pursue an industry-recognised certification such as the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). This will provide hands-on skills in deploying, managing, and troubleshooting applications on Kubernetes.</li>  
                                                <li><strong>Mastery of Infrastructure as Code:</strong> I plan to advance my IaC proficiency by building complex, multi-tier environment scripts in Terraform and mastering its integration with continuous integration tools for automated deployment pipelines.</li>   
                                                <li><strong>Specialisation in Cloud Security:</strong> I intend to formalise my security knowledge by working towards a certification like the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP), focusing on developing advanced skills in securing data, applications, and infrastructure across different cloud models.</li>   
                                                <li><strong>Exploration of Serverless and Advanced AI Patterns:</strong> I will dedicate time to building and deploying applications using serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) and explore more advanced cloud-based AI services for predictive analytics and natural language processing, moving beyond automated document processing to more predictive and cognitive tasks.</li>
